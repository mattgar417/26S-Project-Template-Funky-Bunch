## About

Finding and organizing local events is fragmented — people rely on Instagram, word of mouth, and a dozen different apps. communevent brings everyone to the same table:

- **Attendees** browse a personalized feed based on their interests and location, RSVP to events, save favorites, and leave reviews
- **Event Organizers** post events, find and book performers, and request venue bookings
- **Performers** manage their profile, receive booking requests from organizers, and track upcoming gigs
- **Venue Owners** review booking requests, manage their calendar, and track weekly revenue

Key features include an ML-powered interest-matching feed, a performer discovery system, and an end-to-end venue booking workflow.

## Setup & Running

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed and running

### Steps

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-folder>
   ```

2. **Create `api/.env`** with the following contents (fill in your own password and secret key):
   ```
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=<your-password>
   DB_HOST=db
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_NAME=CommunEvent
   SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
   MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<your-password>
   ```

3. **Start all services**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   This starts three containers:
   - `db` — MySQL on port 3200
   - `web-api` — Flask REST API on port 4000
   - `app` — Streamlit UI on port 8501

4. **Open the app** at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

### Resetting the database

If you change SQL files in `database-files/`, tear down and recreate the database volume:
```bash
docker compose down
docker volume rm 26s-project-template-funky-bunch_db_data
docker compose up -d
```
